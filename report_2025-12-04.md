## 2. Equity Flow Snapshot (SPX)

**🧠 Structural Signals**
*   **Net Gamma:** -309287809.59
*   **Gamma Slope:** -3248.8554
*   **Net Delta:** 10645.37

**📌 Interpretation**
SPX is in an EXPLOSIVE regime. Dealer positioning is fragile, and flows are likely to amplify volatility rather than dampen it. With Net Gamma deeply negative, dealers are forced to hedge in the direction of the trend (selling into drops, buying into rallies), creating asymmetric risk.

## 3. Commodity Flow Snapshot (GOLD)

**🧠 Structural Signals**
*   **Backwardation:** -0.43%
*   **Spec Net Pos:** 170,000 contracts

**📌 Interpretation**
Gold is in a FRAGILE regime (Score: 50.0). The futures curve is in contango, indicating ample near-term supply. Speculative positioning is stretched long, raising the risk of a washout if momentum stalls.
