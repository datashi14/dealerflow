## 2. Equity Flow Snapshot (SPX)

**🧠 Structural Signals**
*   **Net Gamma:** -607922519.56
*   **Gamma Slope:** 0.0000
*   **Net Delta:** -50164.91

**📌 Interpretation**
SPX is in a FRAGILE regime. Market structure is mixed, creating a path-dependent environment. With Net Gamma deeply negative, dealers are forced to hedge in the direction of the trend (selling into drops, buying into rallies), creating asymmetric risk.

**📌 Interpretation**
Gold is in a FRAGILE regime (Score: 40.0). The futures curve is in contango, indicating ample near-term supply. Speculative positioning is moderate.

*   **Realised Vol (20d):** 8.68%

## 1. Structural Flow
The DealerFlow engine flags SPX as **EXPLOSIVE** (Score 72). Dealers are short gamma, meaning they are forced to sell into weakness and buy into strength. This mechanical hedging flow is currently amplifying volatility, creating a fragile liquidity environment. Meanwhile, cross-border flows show signs of stress, with the Dollar strengthening alongside falling equity markets.

## 2. Reflexivity
A classic reflexive loop is forming in Japan. Rising JGB yields (0.60%) are failing to attract capital because the Yen is simultaneously weakening. This suggests the carry trade unwind is not over; instead, capital is fleeing Japan despite higher nominal rates, which forces the BOJ into a corner.

## 3. The Truth
Consensus believes the "Soft Landing" is locked in. The truth is that structural liquidity conditions are deteriorating. The equity market is supporting the economy, not the other way around. If SPX breaks key dealer levels, the feedback loop reverses.

## 4. Signals to Watch
*   **USDJPY**: If it breaks 152 despite rising JGB yields, the reflexive loop accelerates.
*   **SPX Net Gamma**: Currently negative. Watch for a flip back to positive to signal stability.

## 5. How DealerFlow Tracks This
Our composite instability index captures the interaction between Option Gamma, FX Carry, and Rates Spreads. Today, 3 out of 5 pillars are flashing warning signs.

## 6. Stance
**Cautious / Hedged.** I am reducing gross exposure and holding long volatility positions via VIX calls. The risk/reward for passive long equity is poor until Net Gamma normalizes.
